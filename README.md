# TurboSched
TurboSched: A Modern and Configurable Job Scheduling System

TurboSched aims to be a modern alternative to the traditional job schedulers, e.g. SLURM, PBS, etc. It is designed to be highly configurable and extensible, but mainly focuses on GPU clusters. 

**TurboSched is still under heavy development and is far from even a working prototype at the moment. Any contributions are welcome!**
